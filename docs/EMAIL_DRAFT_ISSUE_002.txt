Subject: Microsoft Agentic AI Weekly #002 — MCP patterns, telemetry, and enterprise readiness

Hi {{first_name}},

Welcome to Microsoft Agentic AI Weekly — high-signal updates for builders shipping on Microsoft’s agent stack.

This week’s signal:
Agent operations is now the differentiator. Teams moving fastest are standardizing MCP/tooling patterns, improving grounding quality, and running weekly telemetry reviews.

Read Issue #002:

Top picks inside:
- MCP server deployment into Copilot Studio (practical build path)
- Dataverse grounding/search patterns that improve answer quality
- Environment-aware flow design for cleaner ALM
- Microsoft’s 2026 readiness framework + admin telemetry updates

Builder takeaway:
Don’t ship one-off agents. Build a repeatable operating model.

If this was useful, forward to one teammate building agents this quarter.
