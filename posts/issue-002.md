# Microsoft Agentic AI Weekly — Issue #002

**Date:** 16 Feb 2026  
**Title:** Agent operations is the new differentiator: MCP tooling, telemetry, and enterprise readiness patterns

## TL;DR
The market is moving beyond demos into repeatable delivery. This week’s strongest signal: independent builders are publishing practical MCP/Copilot Studio implementation patterns while Microsoft is reinforcing readiness, governance, and admin telemetry. Winning teams are standardizing agent architecture and operational reviews now.

**Why it matters:** Small platform constraints can block rollout; practical fixes prevent delivery slowdowns.

### 5) The 6 pillars of agent readiness in 2026 (Microsoft)
**Source:** Official  
**Link:** https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/copilot-studio/the-6-pillars-that-will-define-agent-readiness-in-2026/  
**Why it matters:** Useful framework for governance, adoption, and scaling beyond isolated pilot agents.

### 6) New Power Platform admin usage page (public preview) (Microsoft)
**Source:** Official

**Why it matters:** Better admin telemetry helps teams prove ROI and identify where agent adoption is weak.

## Builder takeaway
Don’t ship one-off agents. Build a repeatable operating model: MCP/tooling standard, grounded knowledge strategy, and weekly telemetry review.

## This week’s action checklist
- [ ] Define one reference architecture for Copilot Studio + MCP + Dataverse grounding
- [ ] Add environment-aware configuration pattern to deployment templates
- [ ] Run a weekly usage/quality review and publish a short internal scorecard
